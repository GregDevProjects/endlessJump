TODO:
- find a way to organize code going forward 
	- use functions as classes for encapulation 
	- 1 file per class
	- avoid globals
- learn how to run on mobile device
	- https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-to-make-a-mobile-virtual-pet-game-with-html5-and-cordova

- work out gameplay 
	- dude with jetpack flying upp
		- collect fuel for a boost
			-overlap with fuel rather than collide?
		- challenges:
			- can have tunnels + enemies 
		-perspective shifts to the side sometimes 
		-start on ground level 
			-gravity is high 
			-fuel is shorter apart
			-rotate camera on entry to space
		-go to space 
			-gravity is low 
			-fuel is longer apart 
	

LVL 1 - underground 
- fuel pickups have different power 
- stuff that can kill you:
	- fire 


CODE STUFF 
- use different groups for different types of platforms 
- tilemaps 
	- http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7102-how-to-use-tiled-map-editor-with-phaser/
	- http://www.mapeditor.org/
	- will need to rethink game according to tilemaps 
		- handling collisions 
		- use objects to map the sprites
			- http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/8471-newbie-question-how-to-remove-a-tile-from-a-game/
			- kind of working right now...
				- gids need to update automatically 
				- pass in custom params to objects
